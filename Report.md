# Credit Risk Classification Report

## Overview of the Analysis

Starting this assignment, the primary purpose of the analysis is to construct a model capable of determining the creditworthiness of borrowers. lenders evaluate credit risk through various methods, our analysis focuses on using Machine Learning to examine the historical lending data provided. The initial dataset provided information regarding the hisorical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending company that was used. I used a number of different methods to evaluate this data. The first was using a logistic regression model. Generally the Logistic Regression Model is used to predict the probability of certain classes based on a number of different variables.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
