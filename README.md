## Summary
In this challenge, we were tasked with creating a model to identify the credit-worthiness of borrowers. The dataset that was provided in order to create this model, included the historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending service company. I had to start of by splitting the data into training/testing sets. After that we had to create a Logistic Regression Model using the data. Finally we had to write a credit risk analysis report. 

## Technologies Used
